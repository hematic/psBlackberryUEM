# Basic Usage
## Installation
```
Install-Module -Name psBlackberryUEM -Repository PSGallery -Force -Scope CurrentUser
```
## API Authentication
When working with an API the first thing you most always need to do is authenticate.
psBlackBerryUEM uses a function **Get-BBUEMAuthString**.

You call this function like so:

```
Get-BBUEMAuthString -Credential <This is a PSCredential OBject> -base_uri <The base part of the URI for your instance. Example: https://server:port/tenantID/api/v1>
```
Instead of returning an object or string to you, this function sets two **Global** scoped variables that are used elsewhere throughout the module.
```
$global:env:uem_environment: This is used to construct the full URI for every other endpoint the module hits.

$global:env:uem_auth_token: This is the Auth Token that is passed in the header for every subsequent call that is made. All of the functions handle passing this for you.
```

Once this basic command has been run, all other functions are available to you. If you need to use different credentials for different endpoints, you will need to re-authenticate between those calls with whatever credential is needed.
